# mapr-streams-mxnet-face
implement mxnet face and insightface with mapr streams for near real time face detection and recognition with deep learning models

# get pre-trained models
After clone the repo, get the face detection from [mxnet-face](https://github.com/tornadomeet/mxnet-face), whereas the model is stored at [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yqn8sken82gpmfr/AAC8WNSaA1ADVuUq8yaPQF0da?dl=0). Also the face recogition model from [insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) whereas the model is stored at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x0-EiYX9jMUKiq-n1Bd9OCK4fVB3a54v/view)

put model-0000.params under "consumer/models/", put mxnet-face-fr50-0000.params under "consumer/deploy"
